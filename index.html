            A montage of seemingly disjointed video clips produced through various interactions between light, texture, and a lens ball.
            The ability of the latter to both magnify and distort allows for a sequence of images that encroach upon the realm of dreams.
            The film is pure in its depiction of such an experience as dreaming, and can be seen as having taken place through the perspective of the so-called "mind's eye."

            A series of kaleidoscopic animations produced as part of a larger collection. 
            Each individual kaleidoscope is representative of one of many "oneiric gods", which are a significant aspect of the publication titled <span class="italic">The Oneiric Afterlife</span>, which can be found at the bottom of this page. 
            The aforementioned gods, also known as "mediators," are not conventional in the sense that they are less like rulers or all-powerful beings and more like sources of sustenance and power for the larger world depicted in the publication.

            Extending further from the world depicted in <span class="italic"> The Oneiric Afterlife </span> is a sample of a seemingly ever-evolving microscopic cell extracted from a creature within said world.
            The idea of the "eye," inextricably linked to the idea of "mind's eye" that is key considering the larger context, makes a direct appearance.
            The abyss that stares back, in this instance, is one that lies out of sight for much of one's life in spite of always being present.
            Such is the nature of the unconscious mind, what Jung deemed "the shadow,"" a void which is always present, even if we are not aware of it.

            Half journalistic, half fictitious, this publication is one that is liminal in the sense of it being of two worlds, yet not belonging to any one of those worlds. 
            It contains stories that have been brought out of one and put into the other, as well as images by various artists, often of a surreal nature, used to provide an evocation of each story.
            At its core, this one is a work infused with the very essence and unconscious workings of the realm of dreams.

            A publication produced as part of a project that sought to compile, organize, and represent a collection of any nature.
            In this instance, the collection featured was that of a large archive of hundreds of cartoon drawings made by William Steig.
            The publications works off of these drawings through the use of simulations, wherein ten random, unrelated drawings are connected via the use of short writing pieces that work to create a larger story.

            This publication instead serves as a compendium of creatures that can be found in various regions, and is told through the perspective of an anonymous individual.
            The illustrations in this book are of note, and suggest a wide variety of creatures, both large and small, docile and aggressive, and perhaps even sentient, possessing greater than average intelligence.

          Hello! My name is Zaid. 
          My practice tends to gravitate around several areas, although I am most passionate about creative coding. 
          My main focus for the time being has been on improving my skills with Three.js, a Javascript library for rendering 3D scenes within websites, as well as Blender in order to model and create those scenes.
          <br>
          <br>
          In general, my free time consists of activities that work to expand my knowledge and taste, such as reading books, watching films, appreciating art, and learning from others.
